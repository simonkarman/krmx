## Other Clients
The client reference implementation has been written in TypeScript as that is the recommended language for the web. Currently, the React TypeScript reference implementation is the only one available. In theory, nothing is stopping you from using the Krmx protocol in another language or web framework.

If you decide to build your own Krmx compatible implementation of a client, then feel free to add that as a reference implementation to this repository by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx).
