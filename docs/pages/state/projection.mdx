# Projection
The Projection model manages complex states where the server maintains the full state, but clients work with a projection of the full state. Which can be a partial and transformed view. It's authoritative and supports optimistic updates through action-based modifications.

> Choose between Atom, Stream, or Projection models based on your application's requirements. Each model has its own strengths and use cases. More information on the models can be found in the [Model Comparison](/state#model-comparison) section.
