# Atom
The Atom model represents a single, atomic piece of synchronizable state. It's ideal for simple, directly mutable values that need to be shared across all clients. Atoms are not authoritative, allowing for updates by all clients.

> Choose between Atom, Stream, or Projection models based on your application's requirements. Each model has its own strengths and use cases. More information on the models can be found in the [Model Comparison](/state#model-comparison) section.
