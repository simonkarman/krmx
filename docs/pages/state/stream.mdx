# Stream
The Stream model implements an append-only log of events or changes. It's authoritative and optimistic, making it suitable for scenarios where the history of changes can be used to derive your state. The stream of events is transparent to all clients.

> Choose between Atom, Stream, or Projection models based on your application's requirements. Each model has its own strengths and use cases. More information on the models can be found in the [Model Comparison](/state#model-comparison) section.
