# Client API
The Krmx client implementation is a NodeJS client and is written in TypeScript.

Take a look at the [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/modules/Krmx_Client.html) and [source code](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx/blob/main/client/src/client.ts) to learn more about the Client API.

If you need help setting up a project with Krmx, then please following the instructions at [Getting Started](/getting-started).

## Creating a Client
A Krmx client can be created using the `createClient` method.

```ts
import { createClient, Props } from '@krmx/client';

const props: Props = { /* configure here */ }
const client = createClient(props);
```

### Props
When creating a client, [configuration properties](/sdk/interfaces/Krmx_Client.Props.html) can be passed to configure it. The exported [Props](/sdk/interfaces/Krmx_Client.Props.html) interface describes these properties.

> The Krmx client doesn't connect to a client until `client.connect(<client-url>)` is invoked.

### Client Lifetime
During the client lifetime, the client status can be used to identify the current state us of the client.

```ts
import { Client, Status } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

const status: Status = client.getStatus();
```

The different status are described by the [Status](/sdk/types/Krmx_Client.Status.html) type. The client can change status by using the `connect`, `link`, `unlink`, `leave` and `disconnect` methods on the client.

#### Connect
The `connect` method is used to connect to a server.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// connect to a server
const serverUrl = 'ws://localhost:8082'
client.connect(serverUrl);
```

For the `serverUrl` argument you have to provide the `ws://` or `wss://` url of the websocket endpoint where your Krmx server is running.

For example: `ws://my-subdomain.example.org:3002/my-game` or `ws://localhost:1234`.

### Link
The `link` field is a method that can be used to link the connection to a user.

The method require the first argument to be set to the username. For example: `link('simon')`.

The method optionally takes a second argument with the authentication of your application as a string. This token is send to the server and will be available in the `on('authenticate', ...)` listener under the `info.auth` field.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// link to a user
const username = 'simon';
client.link(username, 'my-authentication');
```

The link method returns a promise that resolves when the server has linked the connection to the user. Or rejects when the server has rejected the connection. The rejection is an Error with message that represents the latest reason why linking the connection to a user was not successful. Some examples: `'user is already linked to a connection'` or custom messages such as `'server is full'`.

#### Unlink, Leave and Disconnect
The `unlink`, `leave` and `disconnect` methods are used to unlink from a user, leave the server, and disconnect from the server.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// leave the server
client.leave();

// unlink from a user
client.unlink();

// disconnect from the server
client.disconnect();
```

### List Users
You can list all users that are joined on the server.

```ts
import { Client, User } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// get all users
const users: User[] = server.getUsers();
console.info(users); // [{ username: 'simon', isLinked: true }, ... ]
```

### Send Messages
Once a client is connected and linked, you can send messages to the server.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// send a message to the server
const message = { type: 'my/custom', payload: 3 };
client.send(message);
```

See the [Client](/sdk/interfaces/Krmx_Client.Client.html) interface for more information about these methods.

## Events
You can listen to events, such as joining of new users, using an event listener. To do this you can use the client's ` on(eventName, listener): void;` method.

See the client [Events](/sdk/types/Krmx_Client.Events.html) type for more information about the available events.

### Krmx Events
Krmx emits events whenever: a user joins, a connection links to a user, a connection unlinks from a user, a user leaves, and more.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

// example of listening to the 'link' event with an event listener
client.on('link', (username) => {
  console.info('A connection was linked to ', username);
});
```

You can find the explanation of each event type in [the event-based documentation](/learn/event-based) and in the [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/types/Krmx_Client.Events.html).

### Messages (from the server)
When the server send messages, these will be emitted as a `message` event. You can listen to these message using the client's `on('message', <listener>)` method.

```ts
import { Client } from '@krmx/client';
declare const client: Client;

client.on('message', (message) => {
  console.info('server sent:', message);
});
```
