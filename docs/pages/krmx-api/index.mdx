# Introduction
Krmx provides two reference implementations of its protocol. One for a server and one for a client. Both have been written in TypeScript. The server implementation for a NodeJS backend server and the client implementation for a React frontend.

You can also use [the TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/index.html) generated from the Krmx source code.

If you decide to build your own Krmx compatible implementation of a server or client, then feel free to add that as a reference implementation to this repository by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx).
