# Krmx API
Krmx provides implementations of its client and server protocol, both written in TypeScript. The server implementation can be used in a NodeJS backend and the client-react implementation can be used in a React frontend.

> If you're looking for the SDK reference, you can use the [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/index.html) generated from the Krmx source code.

If you decide to build your own Krmx implementation of a server or client in a different language or framework, then feel free to add that implementation by [opening a pull request](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx).

## NodeJS Server API
The Krmx server implementation is a NodeJS backend server and is written in TypeScript. You can use the [API documentation](/krmx-api/server), [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/modules/Krmx_Server.html), or [source code](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx/blob/main/server/src/server.ts) to learn more about the Server API.

## React Client API
The Krmx client implementation is a React context provider with a React provider and is written in TypeScript. You can use the [API documentation](/krmx-api/client), [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/modules/Krmx_Client.html), or [source code](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx/blob/main/client/src/client.tsx) to learn more about the Server API.
