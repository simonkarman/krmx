# React Client API
The Krmx React client implementation provides an external store that wraps the [Krmx Client](/krmx-api/client), so that it can be easily used in React and is written in TypeScript.

Take a look at the [TypeScript SDK reference](/sdk/modules/Krmx_Client_for_React.html) and [source code](https://github.com/simonkarman/krmx/blob/main/client-react/src/client.tsx) to learn more about the React Client API.

If you need help setting up a project with Krmx, then please following the instructions at [Getting Started](/getting-started).

## Creating a new Krmx React Client
The React client API provides a `createClient` method that creates an external store that wraps the Krmx Client. This store can be used in React components to access the Krmx Client.

```tsx
// in your utils/krmx.ts
import { createClient } from '@krmx/client-react';

// Create the client
export const { client, useClient } = createClient(/* props */);
```

This returns an object with two fields: `client` and `useClient`. The `client` field is the Krmx Client instance, and the `useClient` field is a hook that can be used in React components to access the Krmx Client data.

### Properties
To create the client you can supply properties. The properties are the same as the properties of the Krmx Client and can be found in the [Krmx Client Props](/sdk/interfaces/Krmx_Client.Props.html) interface.

## Using useClient hook
The `useClient` hook makes the information from the Krmx protocol, such as unlinked and linked users, available to your React components.

```tsx
"use client";
import { useClient } from '@/utils/krmx.ts';

export default function MyApp() {
  const { status, username, users } = useClient();
  return (<>
    <h1>My App</h1>
    <p>The current status of the client: {status}</p>
    <p>The username (if linked to a user): {username}</p>
    <p>Users: {users.map(u => u.username).join()}</p>
  </>);
}
```

### Fields
The hook returns an object with three fields, that expose part of this information. The `status`, `username`, and `users` fields are described below.

#### Status
The `status` field is of type [Client Status](/sdk/types/Krmx_Client.Status.html), indicates the current status of the Krmx client.

#### Username
The `username` field of type string or undefined. It is undefined when the connection is not linked to a user, and otherwise is the username to which the client is linked on the server.

```tsx
import { useClient } from '@/utils/krmx.ts';

function MyComponent() {
  const { username } = useClient();

  if (username) {
    return <p>Welcome, {username} ðŸ‘‹</p>;
  } else {
    return <p>You're not linked!</p>;
  }
}
```

#### Users
The `users` field is an object, that indicates the users that are known to the servers and provides information about which are currently linked to a connection.

The object has the following Type Definition `{ [username: string]: { isLinked: boolean} };`. Example of its structure

```json
{
    "simon": { "isLinked": true },
    "lisa": { "isLinked": true },
    "rik": { "isLinked": false },
}
```

Example usage of the users field.

```tsx
import { useClient } from '@/utils/krmx.ts';

function UsersComponent() {
  const { users } = useClient();
  return <ul>
     {Object.entries(users)
       .map(([username, { isLinked }]) => (
         <li key={username}>
           {username}
           {!isLinked && ' (disconnected)'}
         </li>)
       )}
   </ul>;
}
```

## Using the client
The `client` field is the Krmx Client instance, and can be used to interact with the Krmx server.

### Example: Connect
Connect to a Krmx server by invoking the `connect` method on the client.

```tsx
import { client } from '@/utils/krmx.ts';

export function MyComponent() {
  return <button onClick={() => { client.connect('ws://localhost:8082'); }}>
    Connect to Krmx server
  </button>;
}
```

For the `serverUrl` argument you have to provide the `ws://` or `wss://` url of the websocket endpoint where your Krmx server is running.

For example: `ws://my-subdomain.example.org:3002/my-game` or `ws://localhost:1234`.

### Krmx Client
Since, the client is simply a wrapper around a Krmx Client, all its other methods can be found in the [Krmx API](/krmx-api/client). They can all be invoked similarly to the connect example above.


## Creating a store
If you want to use the messages from the Krmx Client in your React components, you can create a store that listens to the messages from the Krmx Client.

To do this you can use the `createStore` method that creates a store that listens to the messages from the Krmx Client.

The example below creates a store that listens to messages from the Krmx Client and stores the last 10 messages in the store.
```tsx
// add to your utils/krmx.ts
import { createClient, createStore } from '@krmx/client-react';

/* ... your existing code to create the client ... */
export const { client, useClient } = createClient(/* props */);

// Example Message Store
let id = 0;
export const useMessages = createStore(
  /* the client to create the store for */
  client,

  /* the initial state of the store */
  [] as { id: string, message: string }[],

  /* a reducer returning the new state after each incoming messages */
  (state, message) => {
    id += 1;
    return [...state, { id: crypto.randomUUID(), message: message.type }].slice(-10);
  },

  /* a mapper that can map the state to a different format, which is what will be available when using the hook */
  s => s
);
```

Then you can use the `useMessages` hook in your components to access the messages from the Krmx Client.

```tsx
import { useMessages } from '@/utils/krmx.ts';

export function MyComponent() {
  const messages = useMessages();
  return <ul>
    {messages.map(m => <li key={m.id}>{m.message}</li>)}
  </ul>;
}
```
