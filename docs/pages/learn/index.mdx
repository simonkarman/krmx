# Learn Krmx

When building applications with Krmx, it is important to understand the different components and key concepts. These subjects, including limitations and terminology are explained in the 'Learn Krmx' chapter.

## Introduction
**Krmx** is a network protocol for realtime multi-user interactions. In other words: Krmx uses a server, (one or more) clients, and websocket connections to facilitate multiple users to interact together in realtime.

The key responsibility of Krmx is to abstract away the complexity of individual websocket connections so that the application developer (you!) can focus on the interactive experience between the clients.
