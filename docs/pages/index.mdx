# Krmx

**Krmx** is a TypeScript-based multi-client message sharing protocol build on top of WebSockets. It lets you build server and client implementations in TypeScript with ease.

It was initially build to be used as a tool to facility only multiplayer board games via the browser.

## Quick Start

import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra/components';

To start using Krmx, you can follow the demo project:

<Cards num={1}>
    <Card image arrow title="Demo project" href="https://github.com/binxio/krmx-demo">
        <>![Documentation theme](/assets/demo.png)</>
    </Card>
</Cards>

      </summary>
      <div className="nx-p-2">{children}</div>
    </details>
  )
}

<FAQBox title="Why Krmx?">
  Krmx is the right solution if you're building a (web) application that is designed for users to interact with each other. The original goal was for Krmx to be used for board games, but it can be used outside of that scope too.
